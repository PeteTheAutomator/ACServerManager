Server Installation
-------------------
First, sign-up for an `Amazon Web Services (AWS)`_ account.

Once you have an AWS account, sign-into the AWS console and select a Region that's closes in proximity to you and your
fellow racers; Regions can be found in the drop-down list at the top-right of the console.

You should see a plethora of cloudy offerings - click "EC2" (Virtual Servers in the Cloud) at the top-left.

In the centre of the screen you should see a blue button labelled "Lanuch Instance" - click it.

Next you'll see a bunch of Operating Systems to choose from - the one you want is "Red Hat Enterprise 7.x" and notice
the box beneath the RedHat logo that reads "Free tier available".  Hit the blue "Select" button on the right.

By default the selected Instance Type should be "t2.micro" and on it you should see a green box that reads "Free tier
eligable".  With this Instance Type selected, click the blue "Review and Launch" button at the bottom-right of the page.
