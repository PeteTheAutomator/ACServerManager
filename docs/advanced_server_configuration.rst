Fixed Car Setups
----------------
Let's say you want to "level the playing-field" and have your racers on an identical car setup; `OldGitGamer`_ frequently
does this - it helps make a nice close race.  This can be acheived by copying and pasting the contents of one of your
car setup files into the corresponding car in the Assetto Corsa Server Manager UI.

Locate your car setup - these are individual files in your Documents folder (Documents\\Assetto Corsa\\setups\\<car>\\<track>\\<setup-name>.ini)

Open the car setup you want with a text editor (such as notepad) and copy the contents of the entire file to your
clipboard (CTRL+A followed by CTRL+C).  Then go to your Assetto Corsa Server Manager web UI and locate the same car in
"Car Setups", under the LIBRARY section and paste the contents into the text-area field labelled "Fixed Setup", and
click **Save**.

Finally, to enforce the fixed-setup you just saved, tick the checkbox labelled "Fixed setup" for the Entries within
your Session Presets.
