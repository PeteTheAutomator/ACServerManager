Introduction
------------

`Assetto Corsa`_ is a popular motor-racing simulator for the PC and more recently for current generation consoles.  It
has a thriving online multiplayer community with hundreds of private servers each hosted by enthusiasts to race with
friends.  Running a private server requires substantial technical knowledge to host it, or you could pay a
subscription to a game-server hosting company; even so, managing Assetto Corsa sessions (configuring which tracks,
conditions, cars etc) using the official tool-set leaves a lot to be desired.

This project aims to simplify the process of hosting an Assetto Corsa dedicated server, provides a simple web-based
user-interface for managing the configuration of gaming sessions, AND can allow users to run their server **FREE-OF-CHARGE
for up-to a year!**
